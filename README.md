# Technical Writing Assignment

For guidance on setting up and submitting this assignment, refer to the Marcy lab School Docs How-To guide for [Working with Short Response and Coding Assignments](https://marcylabschool.gitbook.io/marcy-lab-school-docs/fullstack-curriculum/how-tos/working-with-assignments#how-to-work-on-assignments).

## Prompt 1

Arrays, Linked Lists and Doubly Linked Lists all allow programmers to organize data in a sequence. So, how would you choose to use one over the other?

In your response, make sure to compare the time complexities for insertion, removal, and random access (grabbing a particular known element by index/position) for each data structure as well as memory usage and ease of traversal.

### Response 1

## Prompt 2

Imagine you are developing a web browser's "back" button functionality. When a user clicks "back," the browser should navigate to the previously visited webpage.

Would you use a stack or a queue to implement this functionality?

In your response, explain what a Stack/Queue is and why it would be best for this use case. Make sure that your response includes the terms LIFO or FIFO.

### Response 2

When building out a websites "back" button we would implement a stack because it is a "last in first out (LIFO)" lets think of it like something we've experienced. Pancakes or rather a STACK of pancakes, when you pile them on one at a time the first one is usually the last one to be eaten. While the last one you'ved placed on the stack aka the top would be the first eaten. So in the idea of web development we would stack the last website visited on the end of the stack so when the button is pressed it will go back to the last item on the stack aka the past page a user visited.

## Prompt 3

What is an Abstract Data Type and why are they worth learning about?

### Response 3

An Abstract Data Type (ADT) is a theoretical concept in computer science that defines a data type based on the behavior it exhibits, rather than its implementation details. It specifies what actions can be performed on the data and the type of data it can hold, but it does not specify how these actions are executed. ADTs provide a high-level description of data structures, focusing on what they do rather than how they do it.

Learning about it is paramount to understanding the foundational aspects of data structures. Which is why most developers learn about them to this day.

## Prompt 4

A few classic problems involving a stack are the `isBalanced` and `isPalindrome` functions. Choose one of these functions and provide a solution to it along with a brief lesson explaining how it works.
